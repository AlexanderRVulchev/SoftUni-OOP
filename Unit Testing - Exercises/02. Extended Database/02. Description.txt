You already have a class - Database. 
We have modified it and added some more functionality to it. It supports adding, removing, and finding People.
 In other words, it stores People.
 There are two types of finding methods - first: "FindById (long id)" and the second one: 
"FindByUsername (string username)". 
As you may guess, each person has unique id and unique username. Y
our task is to test the provided project.
Constraints
The database should have methods:
•	Add
o	If there are already users with this username, InvalidOperationException is thrown
o	If there are already users with this id, InvalidOperationException is thrown
•	Remove
•	FindByUsername
o	If no user is present by this username, InvalidOperationException is thrown.
o	If the username parameter is null, ArgumentNullException is thrown
o	Arguments are all CaseSensitive
•	FindById
o	If no user is present by this id, InvalidOperationException is thrown
o	If negative ids are found, ArgumentOutOfRangeException is thrown
Hint
Do not forget to test the constructor(s). They are methods too! Also, keep in mind that all the functionality from the previous task still exists and you need to test it again!
