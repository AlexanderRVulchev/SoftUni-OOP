//NOTE: You need a public class StartUp. Create the following hierarchy with the following classes:  

//Create a base class Vehicle. It should contain the following members:
//•	A constructor that accepts the following parameters: int horsePower, double fuel
//•	DefaultFuelConsumption – double 
//•	FuelConsumption – virtual double
//•	Fuel – double
//•	HorsePower – int
//•	virtual void Drive(double kilometers)
//o The Drive method should have a functionality to reduce the Fuel based on the traveled kilometers.
//The default fuel consumption for Vehicle is 1.25. Some of the classes have different default fuel consumption values:
//•	SportCar – DefaultFuelConsumption = 10
//•	RaceMotorcycle – DefaultFuelConsumption = 8
//•	Car – DefaultFuelConsumption = 3
