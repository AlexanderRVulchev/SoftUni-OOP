//NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace PersonsInfo.
//The skeleton from the previous task could be used.
//Create a Team class. Add to this team all of the people you have received.
//Those who are younger than 40 go to the first team, others go to the reserve team.
//At the end print the sizes of the first and the reserved team.
//The class should have private fields for:
//•	name: string
//•	firstTeam: List < Person >
//•	reserveTeam: List < Person >
//The class should have constructors:
//•	Team(string name)
//The class should also have public properties for:
//•	FirstTeam: List<Person>(read - only!)
//•	ReserveTeam: List<Person>(read - only!)
//And a method for adding players:
//•	AddPlayer(Person person): void
